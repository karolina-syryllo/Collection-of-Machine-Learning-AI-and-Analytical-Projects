# Statistical Learning - Linear Regression


## 1. Perform a linear regression to predict the medal count in 2008 and 2012 (separately, in two regressions) from Population and GDP and report your results.

To interpret the results of regression analysis, firstly p-values will be examined to check whether explanatory variables (Population and GDP) are statistically significant. Secondly, values of the estimates will be interpreted in terms of their effect on the output variable, medal count.


P-values decide whether we can reject the null hypothesis that a coefficient has no effect on output variable (is equal to zero). The results are statistically significant if p-value for corresponding coefficient is less than 0.05.
